This project is a Java-based Flight Ticket Management System developed for the Object-Oriented Programming course. The system allows users to search flights, book tickets, manage bookings, and store flight data using object-oriented design principles.

Technologies used include Java, JavaFX, Maven, and GitHub. UML diagrams were created to model the system architecture and class relationships.

This repository contains the source codes used in implementing this project.
