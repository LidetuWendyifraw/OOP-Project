This project is a Java-based Flight Ticket Management System developed as part of our Object-Oriented Programming course. The system is designed to simulate real-world airline ticket operations such as flight scheduling, ticket booking, passenger management, and data persistence.
It applies core OOP principles including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, and integrates a database to store and retrieve flight and booking information. The goal of the project is to build a modular, scalable, and user-friendly application that demonstrates
teamwork, software design skills, and practical implementation of Java programming concepts.
